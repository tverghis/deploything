# agent-test-server

A WebSocket server for manually testing the deploything agent (`agent_bin`).

The agent is a WebSocket client that connects to `agent-test-server` (this tool). This allows sending protobuf-encoded commands and inspecting the agents responses.

## Setup

```bash
cd agent/agent-test-server
uv sync --all-extras
make proto
```

## Usage

Start the test server:

```bash
uv run agent-test-server
```

In another terminal, start the agent:

```bash
cd agent/agent_bin
cargo run
```

Once connected, send commands interactively:

```
[connected] > run nginx latest
[connected] > stop abc123
[connected] > status
[connected] > list
[connected] > help
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `run <image> [tag]` | Send a run command to the agent |
| `stop <id>` | Send a stop command for a container |
| `status` | Show connection status |
| `list` | List containers started this session |
| `help` | Show available commands |
| `quit` | Exit |
